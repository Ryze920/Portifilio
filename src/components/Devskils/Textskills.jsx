        I use technologies for web and app development, including basic
        languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience with
        popular frameworks and libraries, namely React and Tailwind CSS, and I
        am familiar with Bootstrap to speed up the design process. On the
        backend side, I am proficient in using Node.js and PHP. In addition, I
        also have video editing skills with DaVinci Resolve.
